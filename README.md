# Quiz Game

I created a Quiz game using python. The quiz allows the user to test their general knowledge with two different difficulty levels and a sixty seconds time limit.

# Technologies used
* PYTHON

### Time Limit
* I added a time limit to add a sense of urgency and enhance the user experience and also increase replayability.


 ## Future Features 

 * I would like to add a modal for the player to enter a username which opens automatically on page load and insert the username into the game in place of the term "player" to make a better user experience.

## Testing

* I tested the quiz on multiple browsers eg Chrome, Firefox and Chrome and on multiple devices.
* I tested entering multiple inputs.
* I tested entering invalid inputs.


## Bugs

### Solved

* There was an indentation error which pretvented the quiz game from loading which i solved by eye and indenting.
* the game would not accept lowercase answers as correct answers i solved this by converting the user input to .upper


## Validator Testing ### PYTHON


There are no errors remaining in the pep8 validator
