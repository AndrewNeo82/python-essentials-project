# Quiz Game

I created a Quiz game using python. The quiz allows the user to test their general knowledge with two different difficulty levels and a sixty seconds time limit.

# Technologies used

### Time Limit
* I added a time limit to add a sense of urgency and enhance the user experience and also increase replayability.


### Message 

* 



  ### Game Over

* 

 ## Future Features 

 * I would like to add a modal for the player to enter a username which opens automatically on page load and insert the username into the game in place of the term "player" to make a better user experience.

## Testing

* I tested the quiz on multiple browsers eg Chrome, Firefox and Chrome and on multiple devices.

* The buttons shake as intended on all device types and rapid pressing of the ssame button in succession will not break the game or affect the game counting of the score.

## Bugs

### Solved

* There was an indentation error which pretvented the quiz game from loading which i solved by eye and indenting.
* the game would not accept lowercase answers as correct answers i solved this by converting the user input to .upper



## Validator Testing

there are no errors remaining in the pep8 validator
